# Search-algorithms
## Two searching algorithms are developed for learning purposes using C++

I developed two algorithms of finding an element in an array. The first is the barrier method, when we use the key like a barrier to speed up the search. 
The second is the fire method where we use a special formula to determine the index of key in the sorted array.
Also I compared these two algorithms for speed and number of steps to determine the best one.

My project has SearchAlgorithms.cpp file that contains the code.
